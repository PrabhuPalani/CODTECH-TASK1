Overview of the Project

*****EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) on clean_chatgpt reviews Dataset*****

**Objective:**
  To perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations,and outliers. 
  Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

**Key Activities:**
 
 1.Data Loading and Preprocessing:
          Loaded the dataset and converted date columns to appropriate formats.
          Checked for and identified any missing values.
 
 2.Descriptive Statistics:
          Calculated basic statistics for numerical columns, such as scores and thumbs-up counts.

 
 3.Data Visualization:
          Created bar plots to visualize the distribution of review scores.
          Developed a heatmap to illustrate correlations between numerical features.

 
 4.Insights Extraction:
          Analyzed the distribution patterns and correlations to draw initial insights into the dataset.

**Technologies Used :**

1. **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
2. **Pandas**: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
3. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
4. **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
5. **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization, particularly for creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
